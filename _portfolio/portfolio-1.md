title: "Incorporating Large-Scale Human-Mobility Data to Assess Environmental Exposure"
excerpt: "Short description of portfolio item number 1<br/><img src='/images/500x300.png'>"
collection: Traditional place-based measures of the community food environment may misrepresent individualsâ€™ true exposure and its relation to dietary outcomes. To address this, I leveraged large-scale GPS-based restaurant-visit data from Greater Hartford, Connecticut, to map visit patterns and examine neighborhood socioeconomic influences. The findings highlight the role of community-level factors in shaping food patronage and underscore the importance of incorporating human-mobility data into exposure assessments. These insights provide guidance for policymakers to identify activity-based food deserts, optimize zoning, and reduce diet-related health disparities.
