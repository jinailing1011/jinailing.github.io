Traditional place-based measures of the community food environment may misrepresent individualsâ€™ true exposure and its relation to dietary outcomes. To address this, I leveraged large-scale GPS-based restaurant-visit data from Greater Hartford, Connecticut, to map visit patterns and examine neighborhood socioeconomic influences. The findings highlight the role of community-level factors in shaping food patronage and underscore the importance of incorporating human-mobility data into exposure assessments. These insights provide guidance for policymakers to identify activity-based food deserts, optimize zoning, and reduce diet-related health disparities.

Restaurant-visit patterns in the Greater Hartford region. (a) shows overall restaurant-visit patterns in the Greater Hartford region, and (b) zooms into East Hartford, West Hartford, and Hartford. Each line connects a restaurant to a census tract. Line thickness indicates the number of visits; line color indicates the percentile-ranking of SVI for the census tract where the restaurant is located (darker means more socially vulnerable). Only relations with more than 41 visits (top 25% percentile) are included in the figure.
